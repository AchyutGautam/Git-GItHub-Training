# I am Dipak Gautam living in Pepsicola, Kathmandu.
To talk about these 3 days of Git and GitHub Training, it has been a wonderful experience. 
These 3 days helped me acquire basic to intermediate ideas and working mechanisms of git and github. 
Also, the quiz session really helped to get my ideas of git and github more clearer and understanable.

I would love to have some advanced level training on git and github in the days to come.

In the end, I am really thankful to Genese Cloud Academy for such an amazing training. 
Last but not the list, I would like to show my humble gratitude to Milan sir for his easily understandable ways teaching style with practical approach. 
My deepest thanks and regards to the entire team.

Thank you.
