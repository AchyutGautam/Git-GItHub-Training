Hello, I'm Manish Nhuchhe from Bhaktapur, Nepal. This 3 days session of 
git and github has been great. I have learn a lot about it in very short 
time. I am sure that this experience will help a lot in future. I would
like to thank GCA team and our instructor Milan Thapa for helping us to 
learn in this session.

I am looking forward for more session like these.
