Hello, I am Shova Kuikel from Pokhara. I am Pursuing my Bachelors Degree in 
Computer Engineering at WRC,IOE. My email address is shovakuikel1@gmail.com.

3 days GIT and GITHUB training was more than i have expected. It was so fruitful . Now i am clear about the basic and intermediate
working of git and github. I would like to suggest to bring more advance course on git and github in coming days.I will be more than glad to 
participate on that course too.

I would like to thanks Genese Cloud Academy for this opportunity. And I am really grateful to Mr.Milan Thapa sir for teaching and guiding us 
through out the session .Thank you so much sir.
