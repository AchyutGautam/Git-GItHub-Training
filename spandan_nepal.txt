What i expected during the session was, to learn the basics of git commands and use git to connect with github. 
The three days training was fruitful and it met most of my expectations.

My suggestions, 
At the end of the 3rd day, it would be helpful if you could've showed a roadmap which we could follow to learn more advanced stuff about git and github. 
Other than this i was quiet satisfied with the trainnig and would like to thank GCA and Milan Thapa for this wonderful 3 day workshop.
Hoping to attend more workshops like this in the future.
